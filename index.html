        <h1>Site Information</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Exeon. Obviously, Exeon is a temporary site name because I just cannot think of an actual good
            name.
            So for now, I will just stick with it. But anyway, this site is going to be used for/to
            showcases and tutorials for my mods, games, random-gens, ect... all that I will be making in the short
            future.
            Hopefully, I can fill this site with many different things in the future.</p>

        <p>If you would like to help contribute to the making and creation
            of this site click this <a href="https://github.com/DELUXEHUNTER/exeon">link</a>.
            Anyone may contribute to the site as long as they do not ruin the site for the others
            or remove major things like one of the generators, ect...
            If you contribute and want to have credit for a page you add then add it to the footer or something else
            located near the bottom of the page, this probably seems obvious, or if wanted add a credit file. and add
            your name to it

        </p>
