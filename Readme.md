# Newport Institution
The Newport Institution site is an entirely fictional website for a mental institution. The site will contain lore written in records, accounts, and reviews of the institution. 
I don't really know what to do for this site but please acknowledge that there might be some gorey or unpleasent content and might be triggering mentions of topics such as suicide and other things. It might not be too bad until later on for now it is mellow and not very extreme but this might change. 
A disclaimer a lot of the content in this come from someone who doesn't study mental disorders so if I've offended you in some way I'm very sorry and this isn't supposed to be offensive in any way.


This site is made for lore for both a roleplay, and for the series of Neo games, some individuals found inside of the hospital might be named after important figures or characters of the games. Everything in this site is subject to change including the usage of it, I will back everything up if someone contributes their own pages, but for now if something is changed, I entirely clear it. This site is going to be worked on alongside my game The lands of Neoa, where a patient believes they are the king of this fictional land. All of these games will be connected to newport somehow because It allows me to have some kind of reference.

I don't really know what to write for this.
