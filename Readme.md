This is a project I will be working on for the foreseable future, I'm hoping to just have fun and add things as I learn more and more code to eventually make an actual website/improve the site drastically. It would be nice to get help making this site, and just working on other coding projects too.
<div>I'm not very good at coding but this sites mainly just for fun, but please if you see any issues, or just want to request changes use the github issues, or disscussions if I open them up. <div>
