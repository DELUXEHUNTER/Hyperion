This is my first website and I will be using tutorials and some of it will be trial and error, without the tutorials I probably couldn't do this in the amount of time that I have
<div>This is a project I will be working on for the foreseable future, I'm hoping to just have fun and add things as I learn more and more code to eventually make an actual website/improve the site drastically. It would be nice to get help making this site, and just working on other coding projects too. But for now I'm going to do whatever by myself until I get help, or try to at least<div>

<div>I'm not very good at coding but this sites mainly just for fun, but please if you see any issues, or just want to request changes use the github issues, or disscussions if I open them up. <div>

In the future I will be gone for three months and this project might become unused/unmaintained until I get back unless someones already contributed
