# Hyperion
This is the Hyperion project, a project I have no Idea what I'll be doing with. But I'm going to try several things. If you come across this repo if you want you can give me ideas by using discussions[if I open them] or issues, and even help me with them. Be warned I'm not a very good coder but I'll try my best

For now Hyperion will just be used to store small codes.
